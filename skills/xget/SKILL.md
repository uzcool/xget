  Guide to use Xget in real developer workflows. Use this skill when a task
  involves Xget URL rewriting, registry/package/container/API acceleration,
  integrating Xget into Git, download tools, package managers, container builds,
  AI SDKs, CI/CD, deployment, or self-hosting, or adapting commands and config
  from the live README `Use Cases` section to the user's files, environment, or
  base URL.

# Xget

Resolve the base URL first:

1. use a domain the user explicitly gave
2. otherwise use `XGET_BASE_URL` from the environment
3. if neither exists, ask for the user's Xget base URL and whether it should be
   set temporarily for the current shell/session or persistently for future
   shells
4. use `https://xget.example.com` only as a clearly labeled placeholder for docs
   or templates that do not have a real deployment yet

Prefer `scripts/xget.mjs` over manual guessing for live platform data, URL
conversion, and README `Use Cases` lookup. From the repository root, run
`node scripts/xget.mjs ...`; from the skill directory itself, run
`node scripts/xget.mjs ...`. Open [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md)
only when the user needs shell setup, deployment, or troubleshooting details.

## Workflow

1. Classify the task before reaching for examples:
   - one-off URL conversion or prefix lookup
   - Git or download-tool acceleration
   - package-manager or language-ecosystem configuration
   - container image, Dockerfile, Kubernetes, or CI/CD acceleration
   - AI SDK / inference API base-URL configuration
   - deploying or self-hosting Xget itself
2. Complete the base-URL preflight above. If the user wants help setting
   `XGET_BASE_URL`, open [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) and give
   shell-appropriate temporary or persistent commands before continuing.
3. Pull live README guidance in two steps instead of loading the whole section
   by default:
   - list candidate headings with `node scripts/xget.mjs topics --format json`
   - narrow with `--match` or fetch a specific section with
     `node scripts/xget.mjs snippet --base-url https://xget.example.com --heading "Docker Compose Configuration" --format text`
4. Prefer the smallest relevant live subsection. If a repeated child heading
   like `Use in Project` is ambiguous, fetch its parent section instead.
5. Adapt the live guidance to the user's real task:
   - edit the actual config or source files when the user wants implementation,
     not just explanation
   - keep shell commands aligned with the user's OS and shell
   - preserve existing project conventions unless the user asked for a broader
     rewrite
6. Refresh the live platform map with
   `node scripts/xget.mjs platforms --format json` when the answer depends on
   current prefixes, and use `convert` for exact URL rewrites.
7. Combine multiple live sections when the workflow spans multiple layers. For
   example, pair a package-manager section with container, deployment, or `.env`
   guidance when the user's project needs more than one integration point.
8. Before finishing, sanity-check that every example uses the right Xget path
   shape:
   - repo/content: `/{prefix}/...`
   - crates.io HTTP URLs: `/crates/...` rather than `/crates/api/v1/crates/...`
   - inference APIs: `/ip/{provider}/...`
   - OCI registries: `/cr/{registry}/...`
9. If the live platform fetch fails or an upstream URL does not match any known
   platform, say so explicitly and fall back to the stable guidance in
   [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) instead of inventing a
   prefix.
